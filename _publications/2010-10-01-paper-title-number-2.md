excerpt: 'In recent years, AI chatbots like Gemini and Sora AI have transformed the way businesses interact with clients, offering prompt customer service and enhancing satisfaction. However, my research delves into the challenges these chatbots face despite their advancements. From the need for personalization to limited contextual understanding, inadequate problem-solving capabilities, data privacy concerns, integration challenges, and overreliance on predefined responses, we explore the key areas for improvement. My paper emphasizes the importance of enhancing AI chatbots to handle complex queries, provide personalized responses, and ensure data security. By addressing these challenges, we aim to pave the way for more efficient and user-centric solutions that benefit both businesses and customers. Looking forward to your thoughts and discussions on how we can further improve AI chatbots for optimal performance and customer experience!'
